# Test vectors for the open-source security rating

First, to work with test the vectors,
you need to install [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install).

Then, start `jupyter` with the following command:

```
jupyter notebook
```

Next, open one of the notebooks for specific scores or the entire open-source security rating.
