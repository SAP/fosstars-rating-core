## Known vulnerabilities

1.  [CVE-2020-13945](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-13945): In Apache APISIX, the user enabled the Admin API and deleted the Admin API access IP restriction rules. Eventually, the default token is allowed to access APISIX management data. This affects versions 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5.
1.  [CVE-2021-43557](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43557): The uri-block plugin in Apache APISIX before 2.10.2 uses $request_uri without verification. The $request_uri is the full original request URI without normalization. This makes it possible to construct a URI to bypass the block list on some occasions. For instance, when the block list contains "^/internal/", a URI like `//internal/` can be used to bypass it. Some other plugins also have the same issue. And it may affect the developer's custom plugin.
1.  [CVE-2022-24112](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24112): An attacker can abuse the batch-requests plugin to send requests to bypass the IP restriction of Admin API. A default configuration of Apache APISIX (with default API key) is vulnerable to remote code execution. When the admin key was changed or the port of Admin API was changed to a port different from the data panel, the impact is lower. But there is still a risk to bypass the IP restriction of Apache APISIX's data panel. There is a check in the batch-requests plugin which overrides the client IP with its real remote IP. But due to a bug in the code, this check can be bypassed.
1.  [CVE-2022-25757](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-25757): In Apache APISIX before 2.13.0, when decoding JSON with duplicate keys, lua-cjson will choose the last occurred value as the result. By passing a JSON with a duplicate key, the attacker can bypass the body_schema validation in the request-validation plugin. For example, `{"string_payload":"bad","string_payload":"good"}` can be used to hide the "bad" input. Systems satisfy three conditions below are affected by this attack: 1. use body_schema validation in the request-validation plugin 2. upstream application uses a special JSON library that chooses the first occurred value, like jsoniter or gojay 3. upstream application does not validate the input anymore. The fix in APISIX is to re-encode the validated JSON input back into the request body at the side of APISIX. Improper Input Validation vulnerability in __COMPONENT__ of Apache APISIX allows an attacker to __IMPACT__. This issue affects Apache APISIX Apache APISIX version 2.12.1 and prior versions.
