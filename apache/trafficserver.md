## Known vulnerabilities

1.  [CVE-2002-1013](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2002-1013): Buffer overflow in traffic_manager for Inktomi Traffic Server 4.0.18 through 5.2.2, Traffic Edge 1.1.2 and 1.5.0, and Media-IXT 3.0.4 allows local users to gain root privileges via a long -path argument.
1.  [CVE-2010-2952](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2010-2952): Apache Traffic Server before 2.0.1, and 2.1.x before 2.1.2-unstable, does not properly choose DNS source ports and transaction IDs, and does not properly use DNS query fields to validate responses, which makes it easier for man-in-the-middle attackers to poison the internal DNS cache via a crafted response.
1.  [CVE-2012-0256](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2012-0256): Apache Traffic Server 2.0.x and 3.0.x before 3.0.4 and 3.1.x before 3.1.3 does not properly allocate heap memory, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via a long HTTP Host header.
1.  [CVE-2014-3525](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2014-3525): Unspecified vulnerability in Apache Traffic Server 3.x through 3.2.5, 4.x before 4.2.1.1, and 5.x before 5.0.1 has unknown impact and attack vectors, possibly related to health checks.
1.  [CVE-2014-10022](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2014-10022): Apache Traffic Server before 5.1.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via unspecified vectors, related to internal buffer sizing.
1.  [CVE-2017-5659](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5659): Apache Traffic Server before 6.2.1 generates a coredump when there is a mismatch between content length and chunked encoding.
1.  [CVE-2015-5206](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2015-5206): Unspecified vulnerability in the HTTP/2 experimental feature in Apache Traffic Server before 5.3.x before 5.3.2 has unknown impact and attack vectors, a different vulnerability than CVE-2015-5168.
1.  [CVE-2014-3624](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2014-3624): Apache Traffic Server 5.1.x before 5.1.1 allows remote attackers to bypass access restrictions by leveraging failure to properly tunnel remap requests using CONNECT.
1.  [CVE-2017-5660](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5660): There is a vulnerability in Apache Traffic Server (ATS) 6.2.0 and prior and 7.0.0 and prior with the Host header and line folding. This can have issues when interacting with upstream proxies and the wrong host being used.
1.  [CVE-2018-8040](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-8040): Pages that are rendered using the ESI plugin can have access to the cookie header when the plugin is configured not to allow access. This affects Apache Traffic Server (ATS) versions 6.0.0 to 6.2.2 and 7.0.0 to 7.1.3. To resolve this issue users running 6.x should upgrade to 6.2.3 or later versions and 7.x users should upgrade to 7.1.4 or later versions.
1.  [CVE-2018-11783](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-11783): sslheaders plugin extracts information from the client certificate and sets headers in the request based on the configuration of the plugin. The plugin doesn't strip the headers from the request in some scenarios. This problem was discovered in versions 6.0.0 to 6.0.3, 7.0.0 to 7.1.5, and 8.0.0 to 8.0.1.
1.  [CVE-2019-9516](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-9516): Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to a header leak, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker sends a stream of headers with a 0-length header name and 0-length header value, optionally Huffman encoded into 1-byte or greater headers. Some implementations allocate memory for these headers and keep the allocation alive until the session dies. This can consume excess memory.
1.  [CVE-2019-10079](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-10079): Apache Traffic Server is vulnerable to HTTP/2 setting flood attacks.

1.  [CVE-2020-9494](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-9494): Apache Traffic Server 6.0.0 to 6.2.3, 7.0.0 to 7.1.10, and 8.0.0 to 8.0.7 is vulnerable to certain types of HTTP/2 HEADERS frames that can cause the server to allocate a large amount of memory and spin the thread.
1.  [CVE-2020-17509](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-17509): ATS negative cache option is vulnerable to a cache poisoning attack. If you have this option enabled, please upgrade or disable this feature. Apache Traffic Server versions 7.0.0 to 7.1.11 and 8.0.0 to 8.1.0 are affected.
1.  [CVE-2021-27737](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-27737): Apache Traffic Server 9.0.0 is vulnerable to a remote DOS attack on the experimental Slicer plugin.
