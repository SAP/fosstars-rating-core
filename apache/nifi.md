1.  [CVE-2018-1310](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-1310): Apache NiFi JMS Deserialization issue because of ActiveMQ client vulnerability. Malicious JMS content could cause denial of service. See ActiveMQ CVE-2015-5254 announcement for more information. The fix to upgrade the activemq-client library to 5.15.3 was applied on the Apache NiFi 1.6.0 release. Users running a prior 1.x release should upgrade to the appropriate release.
1.  [CVE-2018-17195](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-17195): The template upload API endpoint accepted requests from different domain when sent in conjunction with ARP spoofing + man in the middle (MiTM) attack, resulting in a CSRF attack. The required attack vector is complex, requiring a scenario with client certificate authentication, same subnet access, and injecting malicious code into an unprotected (plaintext HTTP) website which the targeted user later visits, but the possible damage warranted a Severe severity level. Mitigation: The fix to apply Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy request filtering was applied on the Apache NiFi 1.8.0 release. Users running a prior 1.x release should upgrade to the appropriate release.
1.  [CVE-2019-10086](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-10086): In Apache Commons Beanutils 1.9.2, a special BeanIntrospector class was added which allows suppressing the ability for an attacker to access the classloader via the class property available on all Java objects. We, however were not using this by default characteristic of the PropertyUtilsBean.
1.  [CVE-2019-10083](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-10083): When updating a Process Group via the API in NiFi versions 1.3.0 to 1.9.2, the response to the request includes all of its contents (at the top most level, not recursively). The response included details about processors and controller services which the user may not have had read access to.
1.  [CVE-2020-1928](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1928): An information disclosure vulnerability was found in Apache NiFi 1.10.0. The sensitive parameter parser would log parsed values for debugging purposes. This would expose literal values entered in a sensitive property when no parameter was present.
1.  [CVE-2020-1942](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1942): In Apache NiFi 0.0.1 to 1.11.0, the flow fingerprint factory generated flow fingerprints which included sensitive property descriptor values. In the event a node attempted to join a cluster and the cluster flow was not inheritable, the flow fingerprint of both the cluster and local flow was printed, potentially containing sensitive values in plaintext.
1.  [CVE-2020-9491](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-9491): In Apache NiFi 1.2.0 to 1.11.4, the NiFi UI and API were protected by mandating TLS v1.2, as well as listening connections established by processors like ListenHTTP, HandleHttpRequest, etc. However intracluster communication such as cluster request replication, Site-to-Site, and load balanced queues continued to support TLS v1.0 or v1.1.
1.  [CVE-2021-20190](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-20190): A flaw was found in jackson-databind before 2.9.10.7. FasterXML mishandles the interaction between serialization gadgets and typing. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.
1.  [CVE-2020-27223](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-27223): In Eclipse Jetty 9.4.6.v20170531 to 9.4.36.v20210114 (inclusive), 10.0.0, and 11.0.0 when Jetty handles a request containing multiple Accept headers with a large number of “quality” (i.e. q) parameters, the server may enter a denial of service (DoS) state due to high CPU usage processing those quality values, resulting in minutes of CPU time exhausted processing those quality values.
1.  [CVE-2021-44145](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44145): In the TransformXML processor of Apache NiFi before 1.15.1 an authenticated user could configure an XSLT file which, if it included malicious external entity calls, may reveal sensitive information.
1.  [CVE-2022-26850](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-26850): When creating or updating credentials for single-user access, Apache NiFi wrote a copy of the Login Identity Providers configuration to the operating system temporary directory. On most platforms, the operating system temporary directory has global read permissions. NiFi immediately moved the temporary file to the final configuration directory, which significantly limited the window of opportunity for access. NiFi 1.16.0 includes updates to replace the Login Identity Providers configuration without writing a file to the operating system temporary directory.
1.  [CVE-2022-29265](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29265): Multiple components in Apache NiFi 0.0.1 to 1.16.0 do not restrict XML External Entity references in the default configuration. The Standard Content Viewer service attempts to resolve XML External Entity references when viewing formatted XML files. The following Processors attempt to resolve XML External Entity references when configured with default property values: - EvaluateXPath - EvaluateXQuery - ValidateXml Apache NiFi flow configurations that include these Processors are vulnerable to malicious XML documents that contain Document Type Declarations with XML External Entity references. The resolution disables Document Type Declarations in the default configuration for these Processors, and disallows XML External Entity resolution in standard services.
1.  [CVE-2022-33140](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-33140): The optional ShellUserGroupProvider in Apache NiFi 1.10.0 to 1.16.2 and Apache NiFi Registry 0.6.0 to 1.16.2 does not neutralize arguments for group resolution commands, allowing injection of operating system commands on Linux and macOS platforms. The ShellUserGroupProvider is not included in the default configuration. Command injection requires ShellUserGroupProvider to be one of the enabled User Group Providers in the Authorizers configuration. Command injection also requires an authenticated user with elevated privileges. Apache NiFi requires an authenticated user with authorization to modify access policies in order to execute the command. Apache NiFi Registry requires an authenticated user with authorization to read user groups in order to execute the command. The resolution removes command formatting based on user-provided arguments.
