## Known vulnerabilities

1.  [CVE-2015-6303](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2015-6303): The Cisco Spark application 2015-07-04 for mobile operating systems does not properly verify X.509 certificates from SSL servers, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof servers and obtain sensitive information via a crafted certificate, aka Bug IDs CSCut36742 and CSCut36844.
1.  [CVE-2016-1324](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-1324): The REST interface in Cisco Spark 2015-06 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource outage) by accessing an administrative page, aka Bug ID CSCuv84125.
1.  [CVE-2016-9177](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-9177): Directory traversal vulnerability in Spark 2.5 allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via a .. (dot dot) in the URI.
1.  [CVE-2017-7678](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-7678): In Apache Spark before 2.2.0, it is possible for an attacker to take advantage of a user's trust in the server to trick them into visiting a link that points to a shared Spark cluster and submits data including MHTML to the Spark master, or history server. This data, which could contain a script, would then be reflected back to the user and could be evaluated and executed by MS Windows-based clients. It is not an attack on Spark itself, but on the user, who may then execute the script inadvertently when viewing elements of the Spark web UIs.
1.  [CVE-2017-12612](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-12612): In Apache Spark 1.6.0 until 2.1.1, the launcher API performs unsafe deserialization of data received by its socket. This makes applications launched programmatically using the launcher API potentially vulnerable to arbitrary code execution by an attacker with access to any user account on the local machine. It does not affect apps run by spark-submit or spark-shell. The attacker would be able to execute code as the user that ran the Spark application. Users are encouraged to update to version 2.2.0 or later.

[CVE-2017-12269](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-12269): A vulnerability in the web UI of Cisco Spark Messaging Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation by the web UI of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting XSS content into the web UI of the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to force a user to execute code of the attacker's choosing or allow the attacker to retrieve sensitive information from the user. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf70587, CSCvf70592.
1.  [CVE-2018-9159](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-9159): In Spark before 2.7.2, a remote attacker can read unintended static files via various representations of absolute or relative pathnames, as demonstrated by file: URLs and directory traversal sequences. NOTE: this product is unrelated to Ignite Realtime Spark.
1.  [CVE-2018-8024](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-8024): In Apache Spark 2.1.0 to 2.1.2, 2.2.0 to 2.2.1, and 2.3.0, it's possible for a malicious user to construct a URL pointing to a Spark cluster's UI's job and stage info pages, and if a user can be tricked into accessing the URL, can be used to cause script to execute and expose information from the user's view of the Spark UI. While some browsers like recent versions of Chrome and Safari are able to block this type of attack, current versions of Firefox (and possibly others) do not.
1.  [CVE-2018-11770](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-11770): From version 1.3.0 onward, Apache Spark's standalone master exposes a REST API for job submission, in addition to the submission mechanism used by spark-submit. In standalone, the config property 'spark.authenticate.secret' establishes a shared secret for authenticating requests to submit jobs via spark-submit. However, the REST API does not use this or any other authentication mechanism, and this is not adequately documented. In this case, a user would be able to run a driver program without authenticating, but not launch executors, using the REST API. This REST API is also used by Mesos, when set up to run in cluster mode (i.e., when also running MesosClusterDispatcher), for job submission. Future versions of Spark will improve documentation on these points, and prohibit setting 'spark.authenticate.secret' when running the REST APIs, to make this clear. Future versions will also disable the REST API by default in the standalone master by changing the default value of 'spark.master.rest.enabled' to 'false'.
1.  [CVE-2018-11804](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-11804): Spark's Apache Maven-based build includes a convenience script, 'build/mvn', that downloads and runs a zinc server to speed up compilation. It has been included in release branches since 1.3.x, up to and including master. This server will accept connections from external hosts by default. A specially-crafted request to the zinc server could cause it to reveal information in files readable to the developer account running the build. Note that this issue does not affect end users of Spark, only developers building Spark from source code.
1.  [CVE-2018-17190](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-17190): In all versions of Apache Spark, its standalone resource manager accepts code to execute on a 'master' host, that then runs that code on 'worker' hosts. The master itself does not, by design, execute user code. A specially-crafted request to the master can, however, cause the master to execute code too. Note that this does not affect standalone clusters with authentication enabled. While the master host typically has less outbound access to other resources than a worker, the execution of code on the master is nevertheless unexpected.
1.  [CVE-2018-11760](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-11760): When using PySpark , it's possible for a different local user to connect to the Spark application and impersonate the user running the Spark application. This affects versions 1.x, 2.0.x, 2.1.x, 2.2.0 to 2.2.2, and 2.3.0 to 2.3.1.
1.  [CVE-2019-10099](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-10099): Prior to Spark 2.3.3, in certain situations Spark would write user data to local disk unencrypted, even if spark.io.encryption.enabled=true. This includes cached blocks that are fetched to disk (controlled by spark.maxRemoteBlockSizeFetchToMem); in SparkR, using parallelize; in Pyspark, using broadcast and parallelize; and use of python udfs.
1.  [CVE-2019-10172](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-10172): A flaw was found in org.codehaus.jackson:jackson-mapper-asl:1.9.x libraries. XML external entity vulnerabilities similar CVE-2016-3720 also affects codehaus jackson-mapper-asl libraries but in different classes.
1.  [CVE-2019-20445](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-20445): HttpObjectDecoder.java in Netty before 4.1.44 allows a Content-Length header to be accompanied by a second Content-Length header, or by a Transfer-Encoding header.
1.  [CVE-2019-12370](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-12370): The Spark application through 2.0.2 for Android allows XSS via an event attribute and arbitrary file loading via a src attribute, if the application has the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission.
1.  [CVE-2020-12772](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-12772): An issue was discovered in Ignite Realtime Spark 2.8.3 (and the ROAR plugin for it) on Windows. A chat message can include an IMG element with a SRC attribute referencing an external host's IP address. Upon access to this external host, the (NT)LM hashes of the user are sent with the HTTP request. This allows an attacker to collect these hashes, crack them, and potentially compromise the computer. (ROAR can be configured for automatic access. Also, access can occur if the user clicks.)
1.  [CVE-2020-9480](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-9480): In Apache Spark 2.4.5 and earlier, a standalone resource manager's master may be configured to require authentication (spark.authenticate) via a shared secret. When enabled, however, a specially-crafted RPC to the master can succeed in starting an application's resources on the Spark cluster, even without the shared key. This can be leveraged to execute shell commands on the host machine. This does not affect Spark clusters using other resource managers (YARN, Mesos, etc).
1.  [CVE-2020-27218](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-27218): In Eclipse Jetty version 9.4.0.RC0 to 9.4.34.v20201102, 10.0.0.alpha0 to 10.0.0.beta2, and 11.0.0.alpha0 to 11.0.0.beta2, if GZIP request body inflation is enabled and requests from different clients are multiplexed onto a single connection, and if an attacker can send a request with a body that is received entirely but not consumed by the application, then a subsequent request on the same connection will see that body prepended to its body. The attacker will not see any data but may inject data into the body of the subsequent request.
1.  [CVE-2020-27223](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-27223): In Eclipse Jetty 9.4.6.v20170531 to 9.4.36.v20210114 (inclusive), 10.0.0, and 11.0.0 when Jetty handles a request containing multiple Accept headers with a large number of “quality” (i.e. q) parameters, the server may enter a denial of service (DoS) state due to high CPU usage processing those quality values, resulting in minutes of CPU time exhausted processing those quality values.
1.  [CVE-2021-32054](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32054): Firely/Incendi Spark before 1.5.5-r4 lacks Content-Disposition headers in certain situations, which may cause crafted files to be delivered to clients such that they are rendered directly in a victim's web browser.
1.  [CVE-2021-38296](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-38296): Apache Spark supports end-to-end encryption of RPC connections via "spark.authenticate" and "spark.network.crypto.enabled". In versions 3.1.2 and earlier, it uses a bespoke mutual authentication protocol that allows for full encryption key recovery. After an initial interactive attack, this would allow someone to decrypt plaintext traffic offline. Note that this does not affect security mechanisms controlled by "spark.authenticate.enableSaslEncryption", "spark.io.encryption.enabled", "spark.ssl", "spark.ui.strictTransportSecurity". Update to Apache Spark 3.1.3 or later
1.  [CVE-2022-33891](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-33891): The Apache Spark UI offers the possibility to enable ACLs via the configuration option spark.acls.enable. With an authentication filter, this checks whether a user has access permissions to view or modify the application. If ACLs are enabled, a code path in HttpSecurityFilter can allow someone to perform impersonation by providing an arbitrary user name. A malicious user might then be able to reach a permission check function that will ultimately build a Unix shell command based on their input, and execute it. This will result in arbitrary shell command execution as the user Spark is currently running as. This affects Apache Spark versions 3.0.3 and earlier, versions 3.1.1 to 3.1.2, and versions 3.2.0 to 3.2.1.
1.  [CVE-2022-31777](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31777): A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Apache Spark 3.2.1 and earlier, and 3.3.0, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the web browser of a user, by including a malicious payload into the logs which would be returned in logs rendered in the UI.
