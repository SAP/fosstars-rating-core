1.  [CVE-2015-3252](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2015-3252): Apache CloudStack before 4.5.2 does not properly preserve VNC passwords when migrating KVM virtual machines, which allows remote attackers to gain access by connecting to the VNC server.
1.  [CVE-2016-3085](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-3085): Apache CloudStack 4.5.x before 4.5.2.1, 4.6.x before 4.6.2.1, 4.7.x before 4.7.1.1, and 4.8.x before 4.8.0.1, when SAML-based authentication is enabled and used, allow remote attackers to bypass authentication and access the user interface via vectors related to the SAML plugin.
1.  [CVE-2013-4317](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2013-4317): In Apache CloudStack 4.1.0 and 4.1.1, when calling the CloudStack API call listProjectAccounts as a regular, non-administrative user, the user is able to see information for accounts other than their own.
1.  [CVE-2019-17562](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-17562): A buffer overflow vulnerability has been found in the baremetal component of Apache CloudStack. This applies to all versions prior to 4.13.1. The vulnerability is due to the lack of validation of the mac parameter in baremetal virtual router. If you insert an arbitrary shell command into the mac parameter, v-router will process the command. For example: Normal: http://{GW}:10086/baremetal/provisiondone/{mac}, Abnormal: http://{GW}:10086/baremetal/provisiondone/#';whoami;#. Mitigation of this issue is an upgrade to Apache CloudStack 4.13.1.0 or beyond.
1.  [CVE-2022-26779](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-26779): Apache CloudStack prior to 4.16.1.0 used insecure random number generation for project invitation tokens. If a project invite is created based only on an email address, a random token is generated. An attacker with knowledge of the project ID and the fact that the invite is sent, could generate time deterministic tokens and brute force attempt to use them prior to the legitimate receiver accepting the invite. This feature is not enabled by default, the attacker is required to know or guess the project ID for the invite in addition to the invitation token, and the attacker would need to be an existing authorized user of CloudStack.
1.  [CVE-2022-35741](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35741): Apache CloudStack version 4.5.0 and later has a SAML 2.0 authentication Service Provider plugin which is found to be vulnerable to XML external entity (XXE) injection. This plugin is not enabled by default and the attacker would require that this plugin be enabled to exploit the vulnerability. When the SAML 2.0 plugin is enabled in affected versions of Apache CloudStack could potentially allow the exploitation of XXE vulnerabilities. The SAML 2.0 messages constructed during the authentication flow in Apache CloudStack are XML-based and the XML data is parsed by various standard libraries that are now understood to be vulnerable to XXE injection attacks such as arbitrary file reading, possible denial of service, server-side request forgery (SSRF) on the CloudStack management server.
