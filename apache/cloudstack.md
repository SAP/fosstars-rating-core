1.  [CVE-2013-2136](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2013-2136): Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Apache CloudStack before 4.1.1 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the (1) Physical network name to the Zone wizard; (2) New network name, (3) instance name, or (4) group to the Instance wizard; (5) unspecified "multi-edit fields;" and (6) unspecified "list view" edit fields related to global settings.

1.  [CVE-2013-4317](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2013-4317): In Apache CloudStack 4.1.0 and 4.1.1, when calling the CloudStack API call listProjectAccounts as a regular, non-administrative user, the user is able to see information for accounts other than their own.
1.  [CVE-2019-17562](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-17562): A buffer overflow vulnerability has been found in the baremetal component of Apache CloudStack. This applies to all versions prior to 4.13.1. The vulnerability is due to the lack of validation of the mac parameter in baremetal virtual router. If you insert an arbitrary shell command into the mac parameter, v-router will process the command. For example: Normal: http://{GW}:10086/baremetal/provisiondone/{mac}, Abnormal: http://{GW}:10086/baremetal/provisiondone/#';whoami;#. Mitigation of this issue is an upgrade to Apache CloudStack 4.13.1.0 or beyond.
