## Known vulnerabilities

1.  [CVE-2017-5649](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5649): Apache Geode before 1.1.1, when a cluster has enabled security by setting the security-manager property, allows remote authenticated users with CLUSTER:READ but not DATA:READ permission to access the data browser page in Pulse and consequently execute an OQL query that exposes data stored in the cluster.
1.  [CVE-2017-9794](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-9794): When a cluster is operating in secure mode, a user with read privileges for specific data regions can use the gfsh command line utility to execute queries. In Apache Geode before 1.2.1, the query results may contain data from another user's concurrently executing gfsh query, potentially revealing data that the user is not authorized to view.
1.  [CVE-2017-9797](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-9797): When an Apache Geode cluster before v1.2.1 is operating in secure mode, an unauthenticated client can enter multi-user authentication mode and send metadata messages. These metadata operations could leak information about application data types. In addition, an attacker could perform a denial of service attack on the cluster.
1.  [CVE-2017-12622](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-12622): When an Apache Geode cluster before v1.3.0 is operating in secure mode and an authenticated user connects to a Geode cluster using the gfsh tool with HTTP, the user is able to obtain status information and control cluster members even without CLUSTER:MANAGE privileges.
1.  [CVE-2017-15696](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-15696): When an Apache Geode cluster before v1.4.0 is operating in secure mode, the Geode configuration service does not properly authorize configuration requests. This allows an unprivileged user who gains access to the Geode locator to extract configuration data and previously deployed application code.
1.  [CVE-2017-15693](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-15693): In Apache Geode before v1.4.0, the Geode server stores application objects in serialized form. Certain cluster operations and API invocations cause these objects to be deserialized. A user with DATA:WRITE access to the cluster may be able to cause remote code execution if certain classes are present on the classpath.
1.  [CVE-2017-15695](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-15695): When an Apache Geode server versions 1.0.0 to 1.4.0 is configured with a security manager, a user with DATA:WRITE privileges is allowed to deploy code by invoking an internal Geode function. This allows remote code execution. Code deployment should be restricted to users with DATA:MANAGE privilege.
1.  [CVE-2017-15694](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-15694): When an Apache Geode server versions 1.0.0 to 1.8.0 is operating in secure mode, a user with write permissions for specific data regions can modify internal cluster metadata. A malicious user could modify this data in a way that affects the operation of the cluster.
1.  [CVE-2020-1938](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1938): When using the Apache JServ Protocol (AJP), care must be taken when trusting incoming connections to Apache Tomcat. Tomcat treats AJP connections as having higher trust than, for example, a similar HTTP connection. If such connections are available to an attacker, they can be exploited in ways that may be surprising. In Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.30, 8.5.0 to 8.5.50 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.99, Tomcat shipped with an AJP Connector enabled by default that listened on all configured IP addresses. It was expected (and recommended in the security guide) that this Connector would be disabled if not required. This vulnerability report identified a mechanism that allowed: - returning arbitrary files from anywhere in the web application - processing any file in the web application as a JSP Further, if the web application allowed file upload and stored those files within the web application (or the attacker was able to control the content of the web application by some other means) then this, along with the ability to process a file as a JSP, made remote code execution possible. It is important to note that mitigation is only required if an AJP port is accessible to untrusted users. Users wishing to take a defence-in-depth approach and block the vector that permits returning arbitrary files and execution as JSP may upgrade to Apache Tomcat 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later. A number of changes were made to the default AJP Connector configuration in 9.0.31 to harden the default configuration. It is likely that users upgrading to 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later will need to make small changes to their configurations.
1.  [CVE-2019-14892](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-14892): A flaw was discovered in jackson-databind in versions before 2.9.10, 2.8.11.5 and 2.6.7.3, where it would permit polymorphic deserialization of a malicious object using commons-configuration 1 and 2 JNDI classes. An attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code.
1.  [CVE-2019-10091](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-10091): When TLS is enabled with ssl-endpoint-identification-enabled set to true, Apache Geode fails to perform hostname verification of the entries in the certificate SAN during the SSL handshake. This could compromise intra-cluster communication using a man-in-the-middle attack.
1.  [CVE-2021-34797](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-34797): Apache Geode versions up to 1.12.4 and 1.13.4 are vulnerable to a log file redaction of sensitive information flaw when using values that begin with characters other than letters or numbers for passwords and security properties with the prefix "sysprop-", "javax.net.ssl", or "security-". This issue is fixed by overhauling the log file redaction in Apache Geode versions 1.12.5, 1.13.5, and 1.14.0.
1.  [CVE-2022-37021](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-37021): Apache Geode versions up to 1.12.5, 1.13.4 and 1.14.0 are vulnerable to a deserialization of untrusted data flaw when using JMX over RMI on Java 8. Any user still on Java 8 who wishes to protect against deserialization attacks involving JMX or RMI should upgrade to Apache Geode 1.15 and Java 11. If upgrading to Java 11 is not possible, then upgrade to Apache Geode 1.15 and specify "--J=-Dgeode.enableGlobalSerialFilter=true" when starting any Locators or Servers. Follow the documentation for details on specifying any user classes that may be serialized/deserialized with the "serializable-object-filter" configuration option. Using a global serial filter will impact performance.
1.  [CVE-2022-34870](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-34870): Apache Geode versions up to 1.15.0 are vulnerable to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via data injection when using Pulse web application to view Region entries.
