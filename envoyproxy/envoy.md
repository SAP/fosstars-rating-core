## Known vulnerabilities

1.  [CVE-2019-7678](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-7678): A directory traversal vulnerability was discovered in Enphase Envoy R3.*.* via images/, include/, include/js, or include/css on TCP port 8888.
1.  [CVE-2019-9901](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-9901): Envoy 1.9.0 and before does not normalize HTTP URL paths. A remote attacker may craft a relative path, e.g., something/../admin, to bypass access control, e.g., a block on /admin. A backend server could then interpret the non-normalized path and provide an attacker access beyond the scope provided for by the access control policy.
1.  [CVE-2019-15225](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-15225): In Envoy through 1.11.1, users may configure a route to match incoming path headers via the libstdc++ regular expression implementation. A remote attacker may send a request with a very long URI to result in a denial of service (memory consumption). This is a related issue to CVE-2019-14993.
1.  [CVE-2019-15226](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-15226): Upon receiving each incoming request header data, Envoy will iterate over existing request headers to verify that the total size of the headers stays below a maximum limit. The implementation in versions 1.10.0 through 1.11.1 for HTTP/1.x traffic and all versions of Envoy for HTTP/2 traffic had O(n^2) performance characteristics. A remote attacker may craft a request that stays below the maximum request header size but consists of many thousands of small headers to consume CPU and result in a denial-of-service attack.
1.  [CVE-2019-18836](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-18836): Envoy 1.12.0 allows a remote denial of service because of resource loops, as demonstrated by a single idle TCP connection being able to keep a worker thread in an infinite busy loop when continue_on_listener_filters_timeout is used."
1.  [CVE-2019-18802](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-18802): An issue was discovered in Envoy 1.12.0. An untrusted remote client may send an HTTP header (such as Host) with whitespace after the header content. Envoy will treat "header-value " as a different string from "header-value" so for example with the Host header "example.com " one could bypass "example.com" matchers.
1.  [CVE-2020-8664](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-8664): CNCF Envoy through 1.13.0 has incorrect Access Control when using SDS with Combined Validation Context. Using the same secret (e.g. trusted CA) across many resources together with the combined validation context could lead to the “static” part of the validation context to be not applied, even though it was visible in the active config dump.
1.  [CVE-2020-11767](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11767): Istio through 1.5.1 and Envoy through 1.14.1 have a data-leak issue. If there is a TCP connection (negotiated with SNI over HTTPS) to *.example.com, a request for a domain concurrently configured explicitly (e.g., abc.example.com) is sent to the server(s) listening behind *.example.com. The outcome should instead be 421 Misdirected Request. Imagine a shared caching forward proxy re-using an HTTP/2 connection for a large subnet with many users. If a victim is interacting with abc.example.com, and a server (for abc.example.com) recycles the TCP connection to the forward proxy, the victim's browser may suddenly start sending sensitive data to a *.example.com server. This occurs because the forward proxy between the victim and the origin server reuses connections (which obeys the specification), but neither Istio nor Envoy corrects this by sending a 421 error. Similarly, this behavior voids the security model browsers have put in place between domains.
1.  [CVE-2020-8663](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-8663): Envoy version 1.14.2, 1.13.2, 1.12.4 or earlier may exhaust file descriptors and/or memory when accepting too many connections.
1.  [CVE-2020-15104](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15104): In Envoy before versions 1.12.6, 1.13.4, 1.14.4, and 1.15.0 when validating TLS certificates, Envoy would incorrectly allow a wildcard DNS Subject Alternative Name apply to multiple subdomains. For example, with a SAN of *.example.com, Envoy would incorrectly allow nested.subdomain.example.com, when it should only allow subdomain.example.com. This defect applies to both validating a client TLS certificate in mTLS, and validating a server TLS certificate for upstream connections. This vulnerability is only applicable to situations where an untrusted entity can obtain a signed wildcard TLS certificate for a domain of which you only intend to trust a subdomain of. For example, if you intend to trust api.mysubdomain.example.com, and an untrusted actor can obtain a signed TLS certificate for *.example.com or *.com. Configurations are vulnerable if they use verify_subject_alt_name in any Envoy version, or if they use match_subject_alt_names in version 1.14 or later. This issue has been fixed in Envoy versions 1.12.6, 1.13.4, 1.14.4, 1.15.0.
1.  [CVE-2020-25018](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-25018): Envoy master between 2d69e30 and 3b5acb2 may fail to parse request URL that requires host canonicalization.
1.  [CVE-2020-35470](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-35470): Envoy before 1.16.1 logs an incorrect downstream address because it considers only the directly connected peer, not the information in the proxy protocol header. This affects situations with tcp-proxy as the network filter (not HTTP filters).
1.  [CVE-2021-21378](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21378): Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance edge/middle/service proxy. In Envoy version 1.17.0 an attacker can bypass authentication by presenting a JWT token with an issuer that is not in the provider list when Envoy's JWT Authentication filter is configured with the `allow_missing` requirement under `requires_any` due to a mistake in implementation. Envoy's JWT Authentication filter can be configured with the `allow_missing` requirement that will be satisfied if JWT is missing (JwtMissed error) and fail if JWT is presented or invalid. Due to a mistake in implementation, a JwtUnknownIssuer error was mistakenly converted to JwtMissed when `requires_any` was configured. So if `allow_missing` was configured under `requires_any`, an attacker can bypass authentication by presenting a JWT token with an issuer that is not in the provider list. Integrity may be impacted depending on configuration if the JWT token is used to protect against writes or modifications. This regression was introduced on 2020/11/12 in PR 13839 which fixed handling `allow_missing` under RequiresAny in a JwtRequirement (see issue 13458). The AnyVerifier aggregates the children verifiers' results into a final status where JwtMissing is the default error. However, a JwtUnknownIssuer was mistakenly treated the same as a JwtMissing error and the resulting final aggregation was the default JwtMissing. As a result, `allow_missing` would allow a JWT token with an unknown issuer status. This is fixed in version 1.17.1 by PR 15194. The fix works by preferring JwtUnknownIssuer over a JwtMissing error, fixing the accidental conversion and bypass with `allow_missing`. A user could detect whether a bypass occurred if they have Envoy logs enabled with debug verbosity. Users can enable component level debug logs for JWT. The JWT filter logs will indicate that there is a request with a JWT token and a failure that the JWT token is missing.
1.  [CVE-2021-28683](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-28683): An issue was discovered in Envoy through 1.71.1. There is a remotely exploitable NULL pointer dereference and crash in TLS when an unknown TLS alert code is received.
1.  [CVE-2021-29492](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29492): Envoy is a cloud-native edge/middle/service proxy. Envoy does not decode escaped slash sequences `%2F` and `%5C` in HTTP URL paths in versions 1.18.2 and before. A remote attacker may craft a path with escaped slashes, e.g. `/something%2F..%2Fadmin`, to bypass access control, e.g. a block on `/admin`. A backend server could then decode slash sequences and normalize path and provide an attacker access beyond the scope provided for by the access control policy. ### Impact Escalation of Privileges when using RBAC or JWT filters with enforcement based on URL path. Users with back end servers that interpret `%2F` and `/` and `%5C` and `\` interchangeably are impacted. ### Attack Vector URL paths containing escaped slash characters delivered by untrusted client. Patches in versions 1.18.3, 1.17.3, 1.16.4, 1.15.5 contain new path normalization option to decode escaped slash characters. As a workaround, if back end servers treat `%2F` and `/` and `%5C` and `\` interchangeably and a URL path based access control is configured, one may reconfigure the back end server to not treat `%2F` and `/` and `%5C` and `\` interchangeably.
1.  [CVE-2020-25752](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-25752): An issue was discovered on Enphase Envoy R3.x and D4.x devices. There are hardcoded web-panel login passwords for the installer and Enphase accounts. The passwords for these accounts are hardcoded values derived from the MD5 hash of the username and serial number mixed with some static strings. The serial number can be retrieved by an unauthenticated user at /info.xml. These passwords can be easily calculated by an attacker; users are unable to change these passwords.
1.  [CVE-2021-32778](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32778): Envoy is an open source L7 proxy and communication bus designed for large modern service oriented architectures. In affected versions envoy’s procedure for resetting a HTTP/2 stream has O(N^2) complexity, leading to high CPU utilization when a large number of streams are reset. Deployments are susceptible to Denial of Service when Envoy is configured with high limit on H/2 concurrent streams. An attacker wishing to exploit this vulnerability would require a client opening and closing a large number of H/2 streams. Envoy versions 1.19.1, 1.18.4, 1.17.4, 1.16.5 contain fixes to reduce time complexity of resetting HTTP/2 streams. As a workaround users may limit the number of simultaneous HTTP/2 dreams for upstream and downstream peers to a low number, i.e. 100.
1.  [CVE-2021-39162](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-39162): Pomerium is an open source identity-aware access proxy. Envoy, which Pomerium is based on, can abnormally terminate if an H/2 GOAWAY and SETTINGS frame are received in the same IO event. This can lead to a DoS in the presence of untrusted *upstream* servers. 0.15.1 contains an upgraded envoy binary with this vulnerability patched. If only trusted upstreams are configured, there is not substantial risk of this condition being triggered.
