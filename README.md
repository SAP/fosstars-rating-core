# Ratings for open-source projects

This is a framework for defining and calculating ratings for open-source projects.
See [docs](https://sap.github.io/fosstars-rating-core/) for more details.

## Security rating for open-source projects

Using open-source software helps a lot but it also may bring new security issues
and therefore increase security risks.
Is it safe to use a particular open-source component?
Sometimes answering this question is not easy.
The security rating for open-source projects helps answering this question.
First, it gathers various data about an open-source project.
Then, it calculates a security rating for it.
The rating helps to assess the security risk that comes with this open-source project.

More details about the security rating
can be found in the [docs](https://sap.github.io/fosstars-rating-core/oss_security_rating.html).

## Requirements

*  Java 8+
*  Maven 3.6.0+
*  Python 3.6.8+
*  Jupyter Notebook 4.4.0+

## Download and installation

The project can be built and installed with the following command:

```
mvn clean install
```

## Open-source security rating calculator

The project offers a command line tool that takes a URL to a project on GitHub,
gathers data about it, and calculates a security rating.

The tool can be run with a command like the following:

```
java -jar target/fosstars-github-rating-calc.jar --token ${TOKEN} --url https://github.com/apache/beam --no-questions
```

The `TOKEN` variable contains a token for accessing the GitHub API.
You can create a personal token in the
[settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) tab in your profile on GitHub.

The output is going to look like the following:

```
[+] Okay, we have a GitHub token, let's try to use it
