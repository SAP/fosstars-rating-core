# Ratings for open-source projects

This is a framework for defining and calculating ratings for open-source projects.
See [docs](https://sap.github.io/fosstars-rating-core/) for more details.

## Security rating for open-source projects

Open-source software helps a lot, but it also may bring new security issues
and therefore increase security risks.
Is it safe to use a particular open-source component?
Sometimes answering this question is not easy.
The security rating for open-source projects helps to answer this question.
First, it gathers various data about an open-source project.
Then, it calculates a security rating for it.
The rating helps to assess the security risk that comes with this open-source project.

More details about the security rating
can be found in the [docs](https://sap.github.io/fosstars-rating-core/oss_security_rating.html).

## Requirements

*  Java 8+
*  Maven 3.6.0+
*  Python 3.6.8+
*  Jupyter Notebook 4.4.0+

## Download and installation

The [jars](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.sap.oss.phosphor/fosstars-rating-core) are available on the Maven Central repository:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.sap.oss.phosphor</groupId>
    <artifactId>fosstars-rating-core</artifactId>
    <version>1.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Or, the project can be built and installed with the following command:

```
mvn clean install
```

## Command line tool for calculating security ratings

There is a command line tool that takes a URL to a project on GitHub,
gathers data about it, and calculates a security rating.

The tool can be run with commands like the following:

```
git clone git@github.com:SAP/fosstars-rating-core.git
cd fosstars-rating-core
mvn package -DskipTests
TOKEN=xyz # use your personal token, see below
java -jar target/fosstars-github-rating-calc.jar --url https://github.com/apache/beam --verbose --token ${TOKEN}
```

The `TOKEN` variable contains a token for accessing the GitHub API.
You can create a personal token in the
[settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) tab in your profile on GitHub.

In the verbose mode, the tool is going to print out the following:

*  Data that was used for calculating a security rating
*  Sub-scores that describes particular security aspects
*  Overall score and label
*  A number of advices on how the rating may be improved.

Here is what the output looks like:

```
