[CVE-2015-5143](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2015-5143): The session backends in Django before 1.4.21, 1.5.x through 1.6.x, 1.7.x before 1.7.9, and 1.8.x before 1.8.3 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (session store consumption) via multiple requests with unique session keys.
1.  [CVE-2015-5963](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2015-5963): contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware in Django 1.8.x before 1.8.4, 1.7.x before 1.7.10, 1.4.x before 1.4.22, and possibly other versions allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (session store consumption or session record removal) via a large number of requests to contrib.auth.views.logout, which triggers the creation of an empty session record.
1.  [CVE-2015-8213](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2015-8213): The get_format function in utils/formats.py in Django before 1.7.x before 1.7.11, 1.8.x before 1.8.7, and 1.9.x before 1.9rc2 might allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive application secrets via a settings key in place of a date/time format setting, as demonstrated by SECRET_KEY.
1.  [CVE-2016-2048](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-2048): Django 1.9.x before 1.9.2, when ModelAdmin.save_as is set to True, allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions and create ModelAdmin objects via the "Save as New" option when editing objects and leveraging the "change" permission.
1.  [CVE-2016-2513](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-2513): The password hasher in contrib/auth/hashers.py in Django before 1.8.10 and 1.9.x before 1.9.3 allows remote attackers to enumerate users via a timing attack involving login requests.
1.  [CVE-2016-6186](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-6186): Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the dismissChangeRelatedObjectPopup function in contrib/admin/static/admin/js/admin/RelatedObjectLookups.js in Django before 1.8.14, 1.9.x before 1.9.8, and 1.10.x before 1.10rc1 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via vectors involving unsafe usage of Element.innerHTML.
1.  [CVE-2016-7401](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-7401): The cookie parsing code in Django before 1.8.15 and 1.9.x before 1.9.10, when used on a site with Google Analytics, allows remote attackers to bypass an intended CSRF protection mechanism by setting arbitrary cookies.
1.  [CVE-2016-9014](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-9014): Django before 1.8.x before 1.8.16, 1.9.x before 1.9.11, and 1.10.x before 1.10.3, when settings.DEBUG is True, allow remote attackers to conduct DNS rebinding attacks by leveraging failure to validate the HTTP Host header against settings.ALLOWED_HOSTS.
1.  [CVE-2017-7234](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-7234): A maliciously crafted URL to a Django (1.10 before 1.10.7, 1.9 before 1.9.13, and 1.8 before 1.8.18) site using the ``django.views.static.serve()`` view could redirect to any other domain, aka an open redirect vulnerability.
1.  [CVE-2017-12794](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-12794): In Django 1.10.x before 1.10.8 and 1.11.x before 1.11.5, HTML autoescaping was disabled in a portion of the template for the technical 500 debug page. Given the right circumstances, this allowed a cross-site scripting attack. This vulnerability shouldn't affect most production sites since you shouldn't run with "DEBUG = True" (which makes this page accessible) in your production settings.
1.  [CVE-2018-6188](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-6188): django.contrib.auth.forms.AuthenticationForm in Django 2.0 before 2.0.2, and 1.11.8 and 1.11.9, allows remote attackers to obtain potentially sensitive information by leveraging data exposure from the confirm_login_allowed() method, as demonstrated by discovering whether a user account is inactive.
1.  [CVE-2018-7536](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-7536): An issue was discovered in Django 2.0 before 2.0.3, 1.11 before 1.11.11, and 1.8 before 1.8.19. The django.utils.html.urlize() function was extremely slow to evaluate certain inputs due to catastrophic backtracking vulnerabilities in two regular expressions (only one regular expression for Django 1.8.x). The urlize() function is used to implement the urlize and urlizetrunc template filters, which were thus vulnerable.
1.  [CVE-2018-14574](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-14574): django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware in Django 1.11.x before 1.11.15 and 2.0.x before 2.0.8 has an Open Redirect.
1.  [CVE-2018-16984](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-16984): An issue was discovered in Django 2.1 before 2.1.2, in which unprivileged users can read the password hashes of arbitrary accounts. The read-only password widget used by the Django Admin to display an obfuscated password hash was bypassed if a user has only the "view" permission (new in Django 2.1), resulting in display of the entire password hash to those users. This may result in a vulnerability for sites with legacy user accounts using insecure hashes.
1.  [CVE-2019-3498](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-3498): In Django 1.11.x before 1.11.18, 2.0.x before 2.0.10, and 2.1.x before 2.1.5, an Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component issue exists in django.views.defaults.page_not_found(), leading to content spoofing (in a 404 error page) if a user fails to recognize that a crafted URL has malicious content.
1.  [CVE-2019-6975](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-6975): Django 1.11.x before 1.11.19, 2.0.x before 2.0.11, and 2.1.x before 2.1.6 allows Uncontrolled Memory Consumption via a malicious attacker-supplied value to the django.utils.numberformat.format() function.
1.  [CVE-2019-12308](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-12308): An issue was discovered in Django 1.11 before 1.11.21, 2.1 before 2.1.9, and 2.2 before 2.2.2. The clickable Current URL value displayed by the AdminURLFieldWidget displays the provided value without validating it as a safe URL. Thus, an unvalidated value stored in the database, or a value provided as a URL query parameter payload, could result in an clickable JavaScript link.
1.  [CVE-2019-12781](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-12781): An issue was discovered in Django 1.11 before 1.11.22, 2.1 before 2.1.10, and 2.2 before 2.2.3. An HTTP request is not redirected to HTTPS when the SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER and SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT settings are used, and the proxy connects to Django via HTTPS. In other words, django.http.HttpRequest.scheme has incorrect behavior when a client uses HTTP.
1.  [CVE-2019-14233](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-14233): An issue was discovered in Django 1.11.x before 1.11.23, 2.1.x before 2.1.11, and 2.2.x before 2.2.4. Due to the behaviour of the underlying HTMLParser, django.utils.html.strip_tags would be extremely slow to evaluate certain inputs containing large sequences of nested incomplete HTML entities.
1.  [CVE-2019-14234](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-14234): An issue was discovered in Django 1.11.x before 1.11.23, 2.1.x before 2.1.11, and 2.2.x before 2.2.4. Due to an error in shallow key transformation, key and index lookups for django.contrib.postgres.fields.JSONField, and key lookups for django.contrib.postgres.fields.HStoreField, were subject to SQL injection. This could, for example, be exploited via crafted use of "OR 1=1" in a key or index name to return all records, using a suitably crafted dictionary, with dictionary expansion, as the **kwargs passed to the QuerySet.filter() function.
1.  [CVE-2019-19118](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-19118): Django 2.1 before 2.1.15 and 2.2 before 2.2.8 allows unintended model editing. A Django model admin displaying inline related models, where the user has view-only permissions to a parent model but edit permissions to the inline model, would be presented with an editing UI, allowing POST requests, for updating the inline model. Directly editing the view-only parent model was not possible, but the parent model's save() method was called, triggering potential side effects, and causing pre and post-save signal handlers to be invoked. (To resolve this, the Django admin is adjusted to require edit permissions on the parent model in order for inline models to be editable.)
1.  [CVE-2019-19844](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-19844): Django before 1.11.27, 2.x before 2.2.9, and 3.x before 3.0.1 allows account takeover. A suitably crafted email address (that is equal to an existing user's email address after case transformation of Unicode characters) would allow an attacker to be sent a password reset token for the matched user account. (One mitigation in the new releases is to send password reset tokens only to the registered user email address.)
1.  [CVE-2020-7471](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-7471): Django 1.11 before 1.11.28, 2.2 before 2.2.10, and 3.0 before 3.0.3 allows SQL Injection if untrusted data is used as a StringAgg delimiter (e.g., in Django applications that offer downloads of data as a series of rows with a user-specified column delimiter). By passing a suitably crafted delimiter to a contrib.postgres.aggregates.StringAgg instance, it was possible to break escaping and inject malicious SQL.
1.  [CVE-2020-9402](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-9402): Django 1.11 before 1.11.29, 2.2 before 2.2.11, and 3.0 before 3.0.4 allows SQL Injection if untrusted data is used as a tolerance parameter in GIS functions and aggregates on Oracle. By passing a suitably crafted tolerance to GIS functions and aggregates on Oracle, it was possible to break escaping and inject malicious SQL.
1.  [CVE-2020-13596](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-13596): An issue was discovered in Django 2.2 before 2.2.13 and 3.0 before 3.0.7. Query parameters generated by the Django admin ForeignKeyRawIdWidget were not properly URL encoded, leading to a possibility of an XSS attack.
1.  [CVE-2020-24583](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-24583): An issue was discovered in Django 2.2 before 2.2.16, 3.0 before 3.0.10, and 3.1 before 3.1.1 (when Python 3.7+ is used). FILE_UPLOAD_DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS mode was not applied to intermediate-level directories created in the process of uploading files. It was also not applied to intermediate-level collected static directories when using the collectstatic management command.
1.  [CVE-2021-3281](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3281): In Django 2.2 before 2.2.18, 3.0 before 3.0.12, and 3.1 before 3.1.6, the django.utils.archive.extract method (used by "startapp --template" and "startproject --template") allows directory traversal via an archive with absolute paths or relative paths with dot segments.
1.  [CVE-2021-23336](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-23336): The package python/cpython from 0 and before 3.6.13, from 3.7.0 and before 3.7.10, from 3.8.0 and before 3.8.8, from 3.9.0 and before 3.9.2 are vulnerable to Web Cache Poisoning via urllib.parse.parse_qsl and urllib.parse.parse_qs by using a vector called parameter cloaking. When the attacker can separate query parameters using a semicolon (;), they can cause a difference in the interpretation of the request between the proxy (running with default configuration) and the server. This can result in malicious requests being cached as completely safe ones, as the proxy would usually not see the semicolon as a separator, and therefore would not include it in a cache key of an unkeyed parameter.
1.  [CVE-2021-28658](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-28658): In Django 2.2 before 2.2.20, 3.0 before 3.0.14, and 3.1 before 3.1.8, MultiPartParser allowed directory traversal via uploaded files with suitably crafted file names. Built-in upload handlers were not affected by this vulnerability.
1.  [CVE-2021-31542](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-31542): In Django 2.2 before 2.2.21, 3.1 before 3.1.9, and 3.2 before 3.2.1, MultiPartParser, UploadedFile, and FieldFile allowed directory traversal via uploaded files with suitably crafted file names.
1.  [CVE-2021-32052](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32052): In Django 2.2 before 2.2.22, 3.1 before 3.1.10, and 3.2 before 3.2.2 (with Python 3.9.5+), URLValidator does not prohibit newlines and tabs (unless the URLField form field is used). If an application uses values with newlines in an HTTP response, header injection can occur. Django itself is unaffected because HttpResponse prohibits newlines in HTTP headers.
1.  [CVE-2021-33203](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-33203): Django before 2.2.24, 3.x before 3.1.12, and 3.2.x before 3.2.4 has a potential directory traversal via django.contrib.admindocs. Staff members could use the TemplateDetailView view to check the existence of arbitrary files. Additionally, if (and only if) the default admindocs templates have been customized by application developers to also show file contents, then not only the existence but also the file contents would have been exposed. In other words, there is directory traversal outside of the template root directories.
1.  [CVE-2021-35042](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-35042): Django 3.1.x before 3.1.13 and 3.2.x before 3.2.5 allows QuerySet.order_by SQL injection if order_by is untrusted input from a client of a web application.
