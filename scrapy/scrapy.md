## Known vulnerabilities

1.  [CVE-2017-14158](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-14158): Scrapy 1.4 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via large files because arbitrarily many files are read into memory, which is especially problematic if the files are then individually written in a separate thread to a slow storage resource, as demonstrated by interaction between dataReceived (in core/downloader/handlers/http11.py) and S3FilesStore.
1.  [CVE-2019-1010142](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1010142): scapy 2.4.0 is affected by: Denial of Service. The impact is: infinite loop, resource consumption and program unresponsive. The component is: _RADIUSAttrPacketListField.getfield(self..). The attack vector is: over the network or in a pcap. both work.
1.  [CVE-2021-41125](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41125): Scrapy is a high-level web crawling and scraping framework for Python. If you use `HttpAuthMiddleware` (i.e. the `http_user` and `http_pass` spider attributes) for HTTP authentication, all requests will expose your credentials to the request target. This includes requests generated by Scrapy components, such as `robots.txt` requests sent by Scrapy when the `ROBOTSTXT_OBEY` setting is set to `True`, or as requests reached through redirects. Upgrade to Scrapy 2.5.1 and use the new `http_auth_domain` spider attribute to control which domains are allowed to receive the configured HTTP authentication credentials. If you are using Scrapy 1.8 or a lower version, and upgrading to Scrapy 2.5.1 is not an option, you may upgrade to Scrapy 1.8.1 instead. If you cannot upgrade, set your HTTP authentication credentials on a per-request basis, using for example the `w3lib.http.basic_auth_header` function to convert your credentials into a value that you can assign to the `Authorization` header of your request, instead of defining your credentials globally using `HttpAuthMiddleware`.
