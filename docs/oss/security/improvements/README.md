# Improving security ratings for open-source projects

The page shows how security ratings changed in a certain period,
and which changes were done in the projects to improve the ratings.

## Open-source projects in scope

The table below lists several open-source projects
and shows how their security ratings changed over time.

For each project, there is a list of improvements that would improve the security rating.
The improvements were derived from the detailed rating reports.
Then, the table provides a list of improvements that were implemented in the project.

[Fosstars Core 1.0.0](https://github.com/SAP/fosstars-rating-core/releases/tag/v1.0.0)
was used to calculate the security ratings.
