## Known vulnerabilities

1.  [CVE-1999-0428](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-1999-0428): OpenSSL and SSLeay allow remote attackers to reuse SSL sessions and bypass access controls.
1.  [CVE-2000-0535](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2000-0535): OpenSSL 0.9.4 and OpenSSH for FreeBSD do not properly check for the existence of the /dev/random or /dev/urandom devices, which are absent on FreeBSD Alpha systems, which causes them to produce weak keys which may be more easily broken.
1.  [CVE-2001-1141](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2001-1141): The Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) in SSLeay and OpenSSL before 0.9.6b allows attackers to use the output of small PRNG requests to determine the internal state information, which could be used by attackers to predict future pseudo-random numbers.
1.  [CVE-2002-0656](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2002-0656): Buffer overflows in OpenSSL 0.9.6d and earlier, and 0.9.7-beta2 and earlier, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via (1) a large client master key in SSL2 or (2) a large session ID in SSL3.
1.  [CVE-2003-0078](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2003-0078): ssl3_get_record in s3_pkt.c for OpenSSL before 0.9.7a and 0.9.6 before 0.9.6i does not perform a MAC computation if an incorrect block cipher padding is used, which causes an information leak (timing discrepancy) that may make it easier to launch cryptographic attacks that rely on distinguishing between padding and MAC verification errors, possibly leading to extraction of the original plaintext, aka the "Vaudenay timing attack."
1.  [CVE-2003-0131](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2003-0131): The SSL and TLS components for OpenSSL 0.9.6i and earlier, 0.9.7, and 0.9.7a allow remote attackers to perform an unauthorized RSA private key operation via a modified Bleichenbacher attack that uses a large number of SSL or TLS connections using PKCS #1 v1.5 padding that cause OpenSSL to leak information regarding the relationship between ciphertext and the associated plaintext, aka the "Klima-Pokorny-Rosa attack."
1.  [CVE-2003-0147](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2003-0147): OpenSSL does not use RSA blinding by default, which allows local and remote attackers to obtain the server's private key by determining factors using timing differences on (1) the number of extra reductions during Montgomery reduction, and (2) the use of different integer multiplication algorithms ("Karatsuba" and normal).
1.  [CVE-2003-0544](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2003-0544): OpenSSL 0.9.6 and 0.9.7 does not properly track the number of characters in certain ASN.1 inputs, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via an SSL client certificate that causes OpenSSL to read past the end of a buffer when the long form is used.
1.  [CVE-2003-0851](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2003-0851): OpenSSL 0.9.6k allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash via large recursion) via malformed ASN.1 sequences.
1.  [CVE-2004-0112](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2004-0112): The SSL/TLS handshaking code in OpenSSL 0.9.7a, 0.9.7b, and 0.9.7c, when using Kerberos ciphersuites, does not properly check the length of Kerberos tickets during a handshake, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted SSL/TLS handshake that causes an out-of-bounds read.
1.  [CVE-2004-0975](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2004-0975): The der_chop script in the openssl package in Trustix Secure Linux 1.5 through 2.1 and other operating systems allows local users to overwrite files via a symlink attack on temporary files.
1.  [CVE-2005-1797](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2005-1797): The design of Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), aka Rijndael, allows remote attackers to recover AES keys via timing attacks on S-box lookups, which are difficult to perform in constant time in AES implementations.
1.  [CVE-2005-2946](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2005-2946): The default configuration on OpenSSL before 0.9.8 uses MD5 for creating message digests instead of a more cryptographically strong algorithm, which makes it easier for remote attackers to forge certificates with a valid certificate authority signature.
1.  [CVE-2005-2969](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2005-2969): The SSL/TLS server implementation in OpenSSL 0.9.7 before 0.9.7h and 0.9.8 before 0.9.8a, when using the SSL_OP_MSIE_SSLV2_RSA_PADDING option, disables a verification step that is required for preventing protocol version rollback attacks, which allows remote attackers to force a client and server to use a weaker protocol than needed via a man-in-the-middle attack.
1.  [CVE-2006-4339](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2006-4339): OpenSSL before 0.9.7, 0.9.7 before 0.9.7k, and 0.9.8 before 0.9.8c, when using an RSA key with exponent 3, removes PKCS-1 padding before generating a hash, which allows remote attackers to forge a PKCS #1 v1.5 signature that is signed by that RSA key and prevents OpenSSL from correctly verifying X.509 and other certificates that use PKCS #1.
1.  [CVE-2006-3738](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2006-3738): Buffer overflow in the SSL_get_shared_ciphers function in OpenSSL 0.9.7 before 0.9.7l, 0.9.8 before 0.9.8d, and earlier versions has unspecified impact and remote attack vectors involving a long list of ciphers.
1.  [CVE-2007-3108](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2007-3108): The BN_from_montgomery function in crypto/bn/bn_mont.c in OpenSSL 0.9.8e and earlier does not properly perform Montgomery multiplication, which might allow local users to conduct a side-channel attack and retrieve RSA private keys.
1.  [CVE-2007-5135](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2007-5135): Off-by-one error in the SSL_get_shared_ciphers function in OpenSSL 0.9.7 up to 0.9.7l, and 0.9.8 up to 0.9.8f, might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted packet that triggers a one-byte buffer underflow.  NOTE: this issue was introduced as a result of a fix for CVE-2006-3738.  As of 20071012, it is unknown whether code execution is possible.
1.  [CVE-2007-4995](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2007-4995): Off-by-one error in the DTLS implementation in OpenSSL 0.9.8 before 0.9.8f allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.
1.  [CVE-2007-5536](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2007-5536): Unspecified vulnerability in OpenSSL before A.00.09.07l on HP-UX B.11.11, B.11.23, and B.11.31 allows local users to cause a denial of service via unspecified vectors.
1.  [CVE-2008-0166](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2008-0166): OpenSSL 0.9.8c-1 up to versions before 0.9.8g-9 on Debian-based operating systems uses a random number generator that generates predictable numbers, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct brute force guessing attacks against cryptographic keys.
1.  [CVE-2008-0891](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2008-0891): Double free vulnerability in OpenSSL 0.9.8f and 0.9.8g, when the TLS server name extensions are enabled, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a malformed Client Hello packet.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.
1.  [CVE-2008-1678](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2008-1678): Memory leak in the zlib_stateful_init function in crypto/comp/c_zlib.c in libssl in OpenSSL 0.9.8f through 0.9.8h allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via multiple calls, as demonstrated by initial SSL client handshakes to the Apache HTTP Server mod_ssl that specify a compression algorithm.
1.

This is caused by a bug in the handling of the ASN.1 CHOICE type in OpenSSL 1.1.0 which can result in a NULL value being passed to the structure callback if an attempt is made to free certain invalid encodings. Only CHOICE structures using a callback which do not handle NULL value are affected.
1.  [CVE-2017-3735](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-3735): While parsing an IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate, it is possible to do a one-byte overread. This would result in an incorrect text display of the certificate. This bug has been present since 2006 and is present in all versions of OpenSSL before 1.0.2m and 1.1.0g.
1.  [CVE-2017-3736](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-3736): There is a carry propagating bug in the x86_64 Montgomery squaring procedure in OpenSSL before 1.0.2m and 1.1.0 before 1.1.0g. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible (although very difficult) because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be very significant and likely only accessible to a limited number of attackers. An attacker would additionally need online access to an unpatched system using the target private key in a scenario with persistent DH parameters and a private key that is shared between multiple clients. This only affects processors that support the BMI1, BMI2 and ADX extensions like Intel Broadwell (5th generation) and later or AMD Ryzen.
1.  [CVE-2016-8610](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-8610): A denial of service flaw was found in OpenSSL 0.9.8, 1.0.1, 1.0.2 through 1.0.2h, and 1.1.0 in the way the TLS/SSL protocol defined processing of ALERT packets during a connection handshake. A remote attacker could use this flaw to make a TLS/SSL server consume an excessive amount of CPU and fail to accept connections from other clients.
1.  [CVE-2017-3738](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-3738): There is an overflow bug in the AVX2 Montgomery multiplication procedure used in exponentiation with 1024-bit moduli. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH1024 are considered just feasible, because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be significant. However, for an attack on TLS to be meaningful, the server would have to share the DH1024 private key among multiple clients, which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701. This only affects processors that support the AVX2 but not ADX extensions like Intel Haswell (4th generation). Note: The impact from this issue is similar to CVE-2017-3736, CVE-2017-3732 and CVE-2015-3193. OpenSSL version 1.0.2-1.0.2m and 1.1.0-1.1.0g are affected. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2n. Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing a new release of OpenSSL 1.1.0 at this time. The fix will be included in OpenSSL 1.1.0h when it becomes available. The fix is also available in commit e502cc86d in the OpenSSL git repository.
1.  [CVE-2018-0739](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-0739): Constructed ASN.1 types with a recursive definition (such as can be found in PKCS7) could eventually exceed the stack given malicious input with excessive recursion. This could result in a Denial Of Service attack. There are no such structures used within SSL/TLS that come from untrusted sources so this is considered safe. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0h (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0g). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2o (Affected 1.0.2b-1.0.2n).
1.  [CVE-2018-0737](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-0737): The OpenSSL RSA Key generation algorithm has been shown to be vulnerable to a cache timing side channel attack. An attacker with sufficient access to mount cache timing attacks during the RSA key generation process could recover the private key. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0i-dev (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0h). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2p-dev (Affected 1.0.2b-1.0.2o).
1.  [CVE-2018-0732](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-0732): During key agreement in a TLS handshake using a DH(E) based ciphersuite a malicious server can send a very large prime value to the client. This will cause the client to spend an unreasonably long period of time generating a key for this prime resulting in a hang until the client has finished. This could be exploited in a Denial Of Service attack. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0i-dev (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0h). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2p-dev (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2o).
1.  [CVE-2016-7056](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-7056): A timing attack flaw was found in OpenSSL 1.0.1u and before that could allow a malicious user with local access to recover ECDSA P-256 private keys.
1.  [CVE-2018-0735](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-0735): The OpenSSL ECDSA signature algorithm has been shown to be vulnerable to a timing side channel attack. An attacker could use variations in the signing algorithm to recover the private key. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0j (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0i). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1a (Affected 1.1.1).
1.  [CVE-2018-0734](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-0734): The OpenSSL DSA signature algorithm has been shown to be vulnerable to a timing side channel attack. An attacker could use variations in the signing algorithm to recover the private key. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1a (Affected 1.1.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0j (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0i). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2q (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2p).
1.  [CVE-2018-5407](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-5407): Simultaneous Multi-threading (SMT) in processors can enable local users to exploit software vulnerable to timing attacks via a side-channel timing attack on 'port contention'.
1.  [CVE-2018-16395](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-16395): An issue was discovered in the OpenSSL library in Ruby before 2.3.8, 2.4.x before 2.4.5, 2.5.x before 2.5.2, and 2.6.x before 2.6.0-preview3. When two OpenSSL::X509::Name objects are compared using ==, depending on the ordering, non-equal objects may return true. When the first argument is one character longer than the second, or the second argument contains a character that is one less than a character in the same position of the first argument, the result of == will be true. This could be leveraged to create an illegitimate certificate that may be accepted as legitimate and then used in signing or encryption operations.
1.  [CVE-2019-0190](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-0190): A bug exists in the way mod_ssl handled client renegotiations. A remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request that would cause mod_ssl to enter a loop leading to a denial of service. This bug can be only triggered with Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.37 when using OpenSSL version 1.1.1 or later, due to an interaction in changes to handling of renegotiation attempts.
1.  [CVE-2019-1559](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1559): If an application encounters a fatal protocol error and then calls SSL_shutdown() twice (once to send a close_notify, and once to receive one) then OpenSSL can respond differently to the calling application if a 0 byte record is received with invalid padding compared to if a 0 byte record is received with an invalid MAC. If the application then behaves differently based on that in a way that is detectable to the remote peer, then this amounts to a padding oracle that could be used to decrypt data. In order for this to be exploitable "non-stitched" ciphersuites must be in use. Stitched ciphersuites are optimised implementations of certain commonly used ciphersuites. Also the application must call SSL_shutdown() twice even if a protocol error has occurred (applications should not do this but some do anyway). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2r (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2q).
1.  [CVE-2019-1543](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1543): ChaCha20-Poly1305 is an AEAD cipher, and requires a unique nonce input for every encryption operation. RFC 7539 specifies that the nonce value (IV) should be 96 bits (12 bytes). OpenSSL allows a variable nonce length and front pads the nonce with 0 bytes if it is less than 12 bytes. However it also incorrectly allows a nonce to be set of up to 16 bytes. In this case only the last 12 bytes are significant and any additional leading bytes are ignored. It is a requirement of using this cipher that nonce values are unique. Messages encrypted using a reused nonce value are susceptible to serious confidentiality and integrity attacks. If an application changes the default nonce length to be longer than 12 bytes and then makes a change to the leading bytes of the nonce expecting the new value to be a new unique nonce then such an application could inadvertently encrypt messages with a reused nonce. Additionally the ignored bytes in a long nonce are not covered by the integrity guarantee of this cipher. Any application that relies on the integrity of these ignored leading bytes of a long nonce may be further affected. Any OpenSSL internal use of this cipher, including in SSL/TLS, is safe because no such use sets such a long nonce value. However user applications that use this cipher directly and set a non-default nonce length to be longer than 12 bytes may be vulnerable. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1 and 1.1.0 are affected by this issue. Due to the limited scope of affected deployments this has been assessed as low severity and therefore we are not creating new releases at this time. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1c (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1b). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0k (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0j).
1.  [CVE-2019-1552](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1552): OpenSSL has internal defaults for a directory tree where it can find a configuration file as well as certificates used for verification in TLS. This directory is most commonly referred to as OPENSSLDIR, and is configurable with the --prefix / --openssldir configuration options. For OpenSSL versions 1.1.0 and 1.1.1, the mingw configuration targets assume that resulting programs and libraries are installed in a Unix-like environment and the default prefix for program installation as well as for OPENSSLDIR should be '/usr/local'. However, mingw programs are Windows programs, and as such, find themselves looking at sub-directories of 'C:/usr/local', which may be world writable, which enables untrusted users to modify OpenSSL's default configuration, insert CA certificates, modify (or even replace) existing engine modules, etc. For OpenSSL 1.0.2, '/usr/local/ssl' is used as default for OPENSSLDIR on all Unix and Windows targets, including Visual C builds. However, some build instructions for the diverse Windows targets on 1.0.2 encourage you to specify your own --prefix. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1, 1.1.0 and 1.0.2 are affected by this issue. Due to the limited scope of affected deployments this has been assessed as low severity and therefore we are not creating new releases at this time. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0l (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0k). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2t (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2s).
1.  [CVE-2018-20997](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-20997): An issue was discovered in the openssl crate before 0.10.9 for Rust. A use-after-free occurs in CMS Signing.
1.  [CVE-2019-1547](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1547): Normally in OpenSSL EC groups always have a co-factor present and this is used in side channel resistant code paths. However, in some cases, it is possible to construct a group using explicit parameters (instead of using a named curve). In those cases it is possible that such a group does not have the cofactor present. This can occur even where all the parameters match a known named curve. If such a curve is used then OpenSSL falls back to non-side channel resistant code paths which may result in full key recovery during an ECDSA signature operation. In order to be vulnerable an attacker would have to have the ability to time the creation of a large number of signatures where explicit parameters with no co-factor present are in use by an application using libcrypto. For the avoidance of doubt libssl is not vulnerable because explicit parameters are never used. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0l (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0k). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2t (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2s).
1.  [CVE-2019-1551](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1551): There is an overflow bug in the x64_64 Montgomery squaring procedure used in exponentiation with 512-bit moduli. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against 2-prime RSA1024, 3-prime RSA1536, and DSA1024 as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH512 are considered just feasible. However, for an attack the target would have to re-use the DH512 private key, which is not recommended anyway. Also applications directly using the low level API BN_mod_exp may be affected if they use BN_FLG_CONSTTIME. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1e (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1d). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2u (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2t).
1.  [CVE-2020-7043](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-7043): An issue was discovered in openfortivpn 1.11.0 when used with OpenSSL before 1.0.2. tunnel.c mishandles certificate validation because hostname comparisons do not consider '\0' characters, as demonstrated by a good.example.com\x00evil.example.com attack.
1.  [CVE-2020-1967](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1967): Server or client applications that call the SSL_check_chain() function during or after a TLS 1.3 handshake may crash due to a NULL pointer dereference as a result of incorrect handling of the "signature_algorithms_cert" TLS extension. The crash occurs if an invalid or unrecognised signature algorithm is received from the peer. This could be exploited by a malicious peer in a Denial of Service attack. OpenSSL version 1.1.1d, 1.1.1e, and 1.1.1f are affected by this issue. This issue did not affect OpenSSL versions prior to 1.1.1d. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1g (Affected 1.1.1d-1.1.1f).
1.  [CVE-2020-1968](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1968): The Raccoon attack exploits a flaw in the TLS specification which can lead to an attacker being able to compute the pre-master secret in connections which have used a Diffie-Hellman (DH) based ciphersuite. In such a case this would result in the attacker being able to eavesdrop on all encrypted communications sent over that TLS connection. The attack can only be exploited if an implementation re-uses a DH secret across multiple TLS connections. Note that this issue only impacts DH ciphersuites and not ECDH ciphersuites. This issue affects OpenSSL 1.0.2 which is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. OpenSSL 1.1.1 is not vulnerable to this issue. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2w (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2v).
1.  [CVE-2020-1971](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1971): The X.509 GeneralName type is a generic type for representing different types of names. One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the "-crl_download" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2x (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2w).
1.  [CVE-2021-23839](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-23839): OpenSSL 1.0.2 supports SSLv2. If a client attempts to negotiate SSLv2 with a server that is configured to support both SSLv2 and more recent SSL and TLS versions then a check is made for a version rollback attack when unpadding an RSA signature. Clients that support SSL or TLS versions greater than SSLv2 are supposed to use a special form of padding. A server that supports greater than SSLv2 is supposed to reject connection attempts from a client where this special form of padding is present, because this indicates that a version rollback has occurred (i.e. both client and server support greater than SSLv2, and yet this is the version that is being requested). The implementation of this padding check inverted the logic so that the connection attempt is accepted if the padding is present, and rejected if it is absent. This means that such as server will accept a connection if a version rollback attack has occurred. Further the server will erroneously reject a connection if a normal SSLv2 connection attempt is made. Only OpenSSL 1.0.2 servers from version 1.0.2s to 1.0.2x are affected by this issue. In order to be vulnerable a 1.0.2 server must: 1) have configured SSLv2 support at compile time (this is off by default), 2) have configured SSLv2 support at runtime (this is off by default), 3) have configured SSLv2 ciphersuites (these are not in the default ciphersuite list) OpenSSL 1.1.1 does not have SSLv2 support and therefore is not vulnerable to this issue. The underlying error is in the implementation of the RSA_padding_check_SSLv23() function. This also affects the RSA_SSLV23_PADDING padding mode used by various other functions. Although 1.1.1 does not support SSLv2 the RSA_padding_check_SSLv23() function still exists, as does the RSA_SSLV23_PADDING padding mode. Applications that directly call that function or use that padding mode will encounter this issue. However since there is no support for the SSLv2 protocol in 1.1.1 this is considered a bug and not a security issue in that version. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2y (Affected 1.0.2s-1.0.2x).
1.  [CVE-2021-3449](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3449): An OpenSSL TLS server may crash if sent a maliciously crafted renegotiation ClientHello message from a client. If a TLSv1.2 renegotiation ClientHello omits the signature_algorithms extension (where it was present in the initial ClientHello), but includes a signature_algorithms_cert extension then a NULL pointer dereference will result, leading to a crash and a denial of service attack. A server is only vulnerable if it has TLSv1.2 and renegotiation enabled (which is the default configuration). OpenSSL TLS clients are not impacted by this issue. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 versions are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1k. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not impacted by this issue. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1k (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1j).
