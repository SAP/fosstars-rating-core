## Known vulnerabilities

1.  [CVE-2015-2080](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2015-2080): Optional[The exception handling code in Eclipse Jetty before 9.2.9.v20150224 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from process memory via illegal characters in an HTTP header, aka JetLeak.]
1.  [CVE-2017-9735](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-9735): Optional[Jetty through 9.4.x is prone to a timing channel in util/security/Password.java, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain access by observing elapsed times before rejection of incorrect passwords.]
1.  [CVE-2020-27216](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-27216): Optional[In Eclipse Jetty versions 1.0 thru 9.4.32.v20200930, 10.0.0.alpha1 thru 10.0.0.beta2, and 11.0.0.alpha1 thru 11.0.0.beta2O, on Unix like systems, the system's temporary directory is shared between all users on that system. A collocated user can observe the process of creating a temporary sub directory in the shared temporary directory and race to complete the creation of the temporary subdirectory. If the attacker wins the race then they will have read and write permission to the subdirectory used to unpack web applications, including their WEB-INF/lib jar files and JSP files. If any code is ever executed out of this temporary directory, this can lead to a local privilege escalation vulnerability.]
1.  [CVE-2020-27218](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-27218): Optional[In Eclipse Jetty version 9.4.0.RC0 to 9.4.34.v20201102, 10.0.0.alpha0 to 10.0.0.beta2, and 11.0.0.alpha0 to 11.0.0.beta2, if GZIP request body inflation is enabled and requests from different clients are multiplexed onto a single connection, and if an attacker can send a request with a body that is received entirely but not consumed by the application, then a subsequent request on the same connection will see that body prepended to its body. The attacker will not see any data but may inject data into the body of the subsequent request.]
1.  [CVE-2020-27223](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-27223): Optional[In Eclipse Jetty 9.4.6.v20170531 to 9.4.36.v20210114 (inclusive), 10.0.0, and 11.0.0 when Jetty handles a request containing multiple Accept headers with a large number of “quality” (i.e. q) parameters, the server may enter a denial of service (DoS) state due to high CPU usage processing those quality values, resulting in minutes of CPU time exhausted processing those quality values.]
1.  [CVE-2021-28163](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-28163): Optional[In Eclipse Jetty 9.4.32 to 9.4.38, 10.0.0.beta2 to 10.0.1, and 11.0.0.beta2 to 11.0.1, if a user uses a webapps directory that is a symlink, the contents of the webapps directory is deployed as a static webapp, inadvertently serving the webapps themselves and anything else that might be in that directory.]
1.  [CVE-2021-28169](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-28169): Optional[For Eclipse Jetty versions <= 9.4.40, <= 10.0.2, <= 11.0.2, it is possible for requests to the ConcatServlet with a doubly encoded path to access protected resources within the WEB-INF directory. For example a request to `/concat?/%2557EB-INF/web.xml` can retrieve the web.xml file. This can reveal sensitive information regarding the implementation of a web application.]
1.  [CVE-2021-34428](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-34428): Optional[For Eclipse Jetty versions <= 9.4.40, <= 10.0.2, <= 11.0.2, if an exception is thrown from the SessionListener#sessionDestroyed() method, then the session ID is not invalidated in the session ID manager. On deployments with clustered sessions and multiple contexts this can result in a session not being invalidated. This can result in an application used on a shared computer being left logged in.]
