## Known vulnerabilities

1.  [CVE-2017-12852](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-12852): The numpy.pad function in Numpy 1.13.1 and older versions is missing input validation. An empty list or ndarray will stick into an infinite loop, which can allow attackers to cause a DoS attack.
1.  [CVE-2014-1858](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2014-1858): __init__.py in f2py in NumPy before 1.8.1 allows local users to write to arbitrary files via a symlink attack on a temporary file.
1.  [CVE-2019-6446](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-6446): ** DISPUTED **   An issue was discovered in NumPy 1.16.0 and earlier. It uses the pickle Python module unsafely, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted serialized object, as demonstrated by a numpy.load call. NOTE: third parties dispute this issue because it is  a behavior that might have legitimate applications in (for example)  loading serialized Python object arrays from trusted and authenticated  sources.
