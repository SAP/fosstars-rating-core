## How to fix it

1.  In earlier times, SAP requested projects to add an API usage section to the LICENSE file. As the LICENSE file should only contain the native license text and the API section has moved to the dep5 file of the REUSE project information, we ask all projects to remove the API section from the LICENSE file.2.  A license file was detected, but it doesn't seem to be approved by SAP. Under normal circumstances, we use Apache 2.0 exclusively for our open source projects. Of course, exceptions apply and should be covered by this check.3.  The README of your projects needs to include a link to the results of the REUSE tool scan as well as a licensing section.
