## How to fix it

1.  You should add information about the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) to the contributions file. Moreover, be sure that there are no longer any references to the outdated contributor license agreement (CLA) in the file.2.  No license file could be found in your repository. Be sure to add a license that can be detected by GitHub.

3.  The README of your projects needs to include a link to the results of the REUSE tool scan as well as a licensing section.
