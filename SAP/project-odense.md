## What is wrong, and how to fix it

### rl-contributor_file-2

You should add information about the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) to the contributions file. Moreover, be sure that there are no longer any references to the outdated contributor license agreement (CLA) in the file.


### rl-contributor_file-1

No contributing guideline file could be found in your repository. Though it's only a recommendation, we'd like to encourage you to add some information that can be detected by GitHub.
