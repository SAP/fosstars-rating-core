## What is wrong, and how to fix it

### rl-license_file-1

No license found in the project

No license file could be found in your repository. Be sure to add a license that can be detected by GitHub.
*  [Licensing a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/licensing-a-repository#determining-the-location-of-your-license)


### rl-reuse_tool-1

The README does not seem to have a badge that points to REUSE status (https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/SAP/cloud-language-servers-container)

The README of your projects needs to include a link to the results of the REUSE tool scan as well as a licensing section.


### rl-vulnerability_alerts-2

The project has unresolved vulnerability alerts
